Overview and Motivation

The included Jupyter notebook deals with several questions that I as a beginning Data Scientist with
a non-technical educational background have such as how my background might or might not limit me and what kinds of skills are most important to focus on. I figured that many others might have the same sorts of questions.

Methodology

Business Understanding- Career change is a common thing today. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/26/career-change-is-the-new-normal-of-working.html">This</a> CNBC headline

After identifying a few columns with data that gives some indications of background or skill, I compared these to salary since this was the only measure of career success I could find in the data. If the results seemed straightforward I simply plotted the results and moved on. If the results raised additional questions I tried to answer those with mixed success.
